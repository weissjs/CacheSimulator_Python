Cache Simulator

Assignment details:

"You will develop your cache simulator to operate as with the cache memory we discussed in class and in
your book. The cache will be configurable with command line options as follows (you may include
default values and make these optional parameters for your program):
  • Block size (number of bytes).
  • Number of blocks in the cache.
  • Associativity (1 for direct, 2 for two-way set associative, etc.)
  • (Extra credit 15%) Implement both random and LRU policies when appropriate.
  
Your program will be given a series of byte addresses (from an ASCII file that contains hex addresses with
one address per line). One such file is provided to you, available in the assignment section of the
blackboard system. Given this input and for the cache as parameterized at the command line, compute
the hit/miss rate. You may choose reasonable values according to your needs.
Your cache only needs to support reads. We will test your code with the test cases you developed as well
as with some additional ones I’ve developed. In this programming assignment’s grading phase, the TA
will meet with each group to discuss your code, your testing, and other details."
